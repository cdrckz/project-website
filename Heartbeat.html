      <h1>Jeepneys: The Heartbeat of Philippine Public Transport</h1>
      <p>A jeepney, also known as jeep, is a Filipino mode of public utility vehicle that has become the most popular and iconic means of public transportation in the Philippines.
        They are known for their affordability and accessibility, serving as a practical and economical way for Filipinos to travel daily. </p>    </div>    
    
    <div class="iconic" id="iconic">
      <h1>An Iconic Filipino Invention</h1>
      <p>Originally born from surplus military vehicles after World War II, jeepneys have transformed into colorful and artistic representations of Filipino culture. Their unique designs
         often reflect the local community’s personality, making them not just a vehicle but a cultural icon.</p>
         <br> <p> Over decades, jeepneys have been the primary mode of public transportation, particularly in urban and rural areas. Affordable and widely accessible, these vehicles have bridged 
        the gap between distant communities, allowing millions of Filipinos to commute to work, school, and other destinations. Their ability to navigate narrow streets and crowded city 
        roads has made them indispensable in the country’s transportation system.</p></br>

    <div class="afford" id="afford">
      <h1>Affordability and Accessibility</h1>
      <p>One of the key reasons for the widespread popularity of jeepneys in the Philippines is their remarkable affordability. The fares for a typical jeepney ride are often much lower than those of 
        other modes of public transportation, such as buses or taxis, making it an economical choice for daily commuters, students, and workers alike. This low-cost fare structure is particularly appealing 
        in a country where many individuals and families operate on tight budgets. Jeepneys operate on well-established routes, providing reliable service that connects various neighborhoods, commercial districts, 
        schools, and workplaces. With frequent intervals and predictable schedules, they minimize wait times, allowing passengers to plan their journeys effectively. This accessibility ensures that even economically 
        challenged individuals can access essential transportation services, enabling them to attend work, school, or medical appointments.</p>
        <br> <p> Moreover, jeepneys enhance social inclusivity by providing affordable transportation for people from various socio-economic backgrounds, particularly students, elderly passengers, and low-wage workers. 
          They are not just a means of travel but also spaces for community interaction, where passengers share stories and experiences. The vibrant decorations reflect the creativity of Filipino culture, making each journey 
          unique. Ultimately, the affordability and accessibility of jeepneys are essential to their popularity, fostering community connectivity and ensuring that everyone can thrive in their neighborhoods.</p></br>

    <div class="practicality" id="practicality">
      <h1>Practicality for Daily Commutes</h1>
      <p>Jeepneys are not only affordable but also exceptionally practical for navigating the diverse terrain of the Philippines. Their design allows them to maneuver through congested city streets and narrow rural roads, 
        making it easy to connect various neighborhoods and remote areas. This capability is particularly beneficial in a country where infrastructure can vary widely, ensuring that even those living in more isolated communities 
        can access transportation. As a result, jeepneys have become a vital resource for many Filipinos, helping them reach their destinations efficiently.</p>
        <br> <p> This practicality is reflected in the daily routines of countless commuters who rely on jeepneys to get to work, school, and essential services. The convenience of set routes and frequent stops makes jeepneys an 
          attractive option for those who need to travel regularly. Furthermore, their adaptability in both urban and rural settings highlights their importance in the country’s transportation landscape. By bridging the gap between 
          different areas, jeepneys play a crucial role in enhancing mobility and fostering connectivity across the Philippines.</p></br>
