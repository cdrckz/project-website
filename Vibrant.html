      <h1>Vibrant Icons on Wheels</h1>
      <p> Few vehicles embody the spirit of a nation like the jeepney, the Philippines’ 
        beloved mode of public transportation. Known for their colorful and vibrant exteriors, 
        jeepneys are more than just a means of getting from one place to another—they are a 
        rolling canvas showcasing Filipino creativity, cultural identity, and their impact on daily life. </p>

      <h1>Filipino Creativity in Jeepney Design</h1>
      <p><div class=quote>The artistry behind jeepneys is a testament to the boundless creativity of Filipinos. </div></p>
      <p>These vehicles are often customized with bright paints, intricate patterns, and striking images that make each jeepney 
        a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Owners and artists collaborate to create designs that reflect personal stories, religious beliefs, 
        or pop culture references. </p>
        <p><div class=quote>From depictions of scenic landscapes to portraits of loved ones, jeepneys become a vibrant fusion of individuality and tradition.</div></p>
        <p>Chrome accents, flashy decals, and elaborate ornaments add an unmistakable flair, making each vehicle a moving expression of pride and identity.</p>
        <br><p>The work that goes into decorating a jeepney is meticulous. Artists use airbrushing techniques to achieve smooth gradients and detailed imagery. Hand-painted 
            slogans or names on the front and sides often add a personal touch, sometimes doubling as a nod to humor or inspiration. </p></br> 
            <p><div class=quote>Each jeepney, with its riot of colors and embellishments, mirrors the artistry and resilience of the people who design and maintain them.</div></p>

      <h1>A Cultural Legacy on the Road</h1>
      <p>The jeepney's design roots trace back to the post-World War II era, when surplus military jeeps were repurposed for public transport. </p>

            influencing fashion, visual arts, and even international perceptions of Filipino culture.</p></br>
