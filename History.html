      <h1>The History of Traditional Jeepneys in the Philippines</h1>
      <p>The traditional jeepney is an iconic symbol of Filipino ingenuity, culture, and resilience. Its journey from a wartime relic to a beloved mode of public transportation reflects the adaptability and creativity of the Filipino people. </p>    
      </div> 

    <div class="iconic" id="iconic">
      <h1>Origins</h1>
      <p>The story of the jeepney began after World War II when surplus military jeeps from the United States were sold or left behind in the Philippines. Filipinos saw an opportunity to repurpose these vehicles into a practical mode of transportation. 
        By extending the frames and adding seating, these jeeps evolved into the first jeepneys, capable of carrying multiple passengers.
        <div class="quote">Over time, these vehicles were transformed into unique works of art, featuring vibrant decorations, religious symbols, and bold colors that celebrated Filipino culture. They quickly became an essential part of daily life, bridging the gap between communities.</p></div>
         <br> <p> With their unique blend of American military heritage and Filipino ingenuity, the jeepneys quickly gained popularity as a mode of public transportation. These vehicles began plying the streets, offering an affordable and accessible means of transportation for the masses. And because the jeepney could navigate both urban and rural terrain, it was quickly adopted across the archipelago.</p></br>
      </div>

    <div class="afford" id="afford">
      <h1>Development Over the Years</h1>
        <p>From their humble beginnings as surplus jeeps, traditional jeepneys underwent numerous changes. The demand for larger, more durable vehicles led to the creation of jeepneys built from scratch. These modern jeepneys were designed with stronger frames, more efficient engines, and improved passenger capacity.</p>
        <br> 
          <p><div class="quote">Despite their evolution, traditional jeepneys retained their colorful and artistic flair. They became mobile canvases for Filipino creativity, with designs reflecting the owner's personality and the community's spirit.</p> </div>
     <br><p> Today, the jeepney has become an integral part of Filipinos’ way of life. Public utility jeepneys (PUJs) are the main mode of public transportation in the country, and millions of Filipinos rely on them for their daily commutes. In fact, a study by the University of the Philippines estimates that around 9 million people ride these vehicles in Metro Manila alone, and Metro Manila represents only around 15% of the country's population. </p> </br>

    <div class="practicality" id="practicality">
      <h1>Cultural Impact</h1>
      <p>Beyond their practicality, jeepneys have become cultural icons. They symbolize Filipino resilience, resourcefulness, and pride. Every jeepney tells a story—whether it's through its intricate designs, catchy slogans, or the lively interactions of its passengers.  <br>
        <br> <p> The jeepney is not merely a mode of transportation; it is a canvas that reflects the soul of Filipino culture. It did not take long for locals to turn the public utility vehicles into mobile works of art. Artists started adorning jeepneys with vibrant paintings, intricate designs, and often humorous slogans, turning each jeepney into a moving masterpiece. </p></br>
        <p><div class="quote">Designing the vehicles allowed Filipinos to showcase their creativity and expressiveness. This helped make the jeepney become a source of pride for the people of the Philippines. </p></div>
